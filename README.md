# SACMP
Secure Agent-Centric Memory Protocol for cryptographically signed AI memory vectors.

# SUMMARY
SACMP introduces a new layer of trust by cryptographically binding agent identity to memory entries.
Existing systems assume: “If you can access the DB, you can trust the data.”
SACMP says: **“Trust only what your agent actually signed.”**
